This is the website that I have developed for ENGL 3844 (Writing and Digital Media). Throughout the semester, I did many different projects to practice the skill of rhetoric persuasion and its attributes (exigence, audience, and constraints) through the usage of digital media: 1) a Professional Blog Post, 2) a 10-15-Minute Podcast, 3) a 3-Minute Video, and 4) a link to my LinkedIn Profile.
