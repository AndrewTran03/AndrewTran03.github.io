To further enhance the capabilities of this website, I used this opportunity to develop a medium to which I can discuss my biography, academic life, achievements / honors, extracurricular activities and organizations that I attend in hopes of displaying my developed professionalism obtained following my graduation from WT Woodson High School and my current attendance at Virginia Tech Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech).

## Version 1.00 (Last Updated - May 21st, 2022):

This is the website that I have developed for ENGL 3844 (Writing and Digital Media). Throughout the semester, I did many different projects to practice the skill of rhetoric persuasion and its attributes (exigence, audience, and constraints) through the usage of digital media: 1) a Professional Blog Post, 2) a 10-15-Minute Podcast, 3) a 3-Minute Video, and 4) a link to my LinkedIn Profile.
